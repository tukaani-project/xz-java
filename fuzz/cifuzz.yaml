## Configuration for a CI Fuzz project
## Generated on 2025-11-13

## The build system used to build this project. If not set, cifuzz tries to
## detect the build system automatically.
## Valid values: "bazel", "cmake", "maven", "gradle", "other"
build-system: gradle

## Engine used for fuzzing, default is "libfuzzer-clang".
## Valid values: "libfuzzer-clang", "honggfuzz-clang", "honggfuzz-gcc"
#engine: libfuzzer-clang

## Sanitizers to use when building fuzz tests. If not set, ASan and UBSan
## are used by default.
#sanitizers:
# - address
# - undefined

## If the build system type is "other", this command is used to build the fuzz
## tests.
#build-command: make my_fuzz_test

## If the build system type is "other", this command is used to list the names
## of already existing fuzz tests in your project. This allows running all fuzz
## tests in the project without listing them explicitly, supports fuzz test
## generation and enables fuzz test completion for commands.
## The listed names should be separated by whitespace and can't include
## whitespaces themselves, i.e. 'fuzz_test1 fuzz_test_2 ...'
#list-fuzz-tests-command: echo my_fuzz_test

## Command-line arguments to pass directly to the build system to use when
## building fuzz tests.
#build-system-args:
# - -DBUILD_TESTS=ON


## Directories containing sample inputs used as seeds for running fuzz tests.
## For general information on seed corpora, see:
## https://docs.code-intelligence.com/glossary#seed-corpus
#seed-corpus-dirs:
# - path/to/seed-corpus

## Directories containing inputs for calculating coverage. These are used in
## addition to inputs found in the directory of the fuzz test.
#corpus-dirs:
# - path/to/corpus

## File containing input language keywords or other interesting byte sequences
## used for running fuzz tests.
## For libFuzzer see: https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#dictionaries
#dict: path/to/dictionary.dct

## Command-line arguments to pass to libFuzzer when running fuzz tests.
## See https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#options for possible options.
#libfuzzer-args:
# - -rss_limit_mb=4096

## Command-line arguments to pass to Honggfuzz when running fuzz tests.
## See https://github.com/google/honggfuzz/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md for possible options.
#honggfuzz-args:
# - --rlimit_rss=4096

## Maximum time to run all fuzz tests. Default is 10 minutes. The time will be
## split up evenly between multiple fuzz tests. To keep running indefinitely,
## set value to 0.
#max-fuzzing-duration: 30m

## Maximum time to run a single fuzz test. Default is 10 minutes.
## To keep running indefinitely, set value to 0.
#max-fuzzing-duration-per-fuzz-test: 30m

## Set to true to print output of the `cifuzz run` command as JSON.
#print-json: true

## Set to true to disable desktop notifications.
#no-notifications: true

## Set style for command output.
## Valid values: "pretty", "plain"
#style: plain
